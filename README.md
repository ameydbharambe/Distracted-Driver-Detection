# Distracted-Driver-Detection
Using a Convolutional Neural Network to classify if a driver is attentive or not. Done through Inspirit AI. 
1. Initially used a KNN to make predictions between classifications. Had accuracy of 48.8 percent. Reason was due to random chance
2. Later created a 2 layer CNN to improve the accuracy of the model. This got accuracy up to 60 percent. Model overfitted
3. Learnt about existing models and implemented and trained a VGG16 Model. According to the confusion matrix, has 89 percent accuracy
